The IR reciever needs to be removed from the bottom of the board.

If the device sending the clock signal is putputting mre than 5V then both resistors are needed. 
Resistors can be anything from 1k to 100k. They just need to be the same value.

If it is putting out 5V then the bottom resitor that connects to ground can be omitted. The top resistors should then be a value smaller than 2k.
